If you do not know the nature of the contracts you enter, the legal aspects of these relationships within the scope of such contracts or the degree of exposure to risk, taking into account the risks, you should not resolve the transactions of those products. Foreign currency and derivative transactions are highly risky, therefore not suitable for many people. Considering your experience, goals, financial resources and other important factors, you should consider how appropriate such actions are for you.<br \/><br \/>1. ACTIVITIES WITH FOREIGN CURRENC\u0130 AND DERIVAT\u0130ON<br \/><br \/>1.1 Leveraged trading means the growth of potential profits; It also means that the losses are enlarged. The lower the margin requirement, the higher the risk of potential harm if the market moves against you. Sometimes the required margins can be as low as 0.5%. When trading using margin, remember that your losses can exceed your initial payment and you may lose more money than you originally invested. The amount of the initial margin may be small compared to the values \u200b\u200bof the foreign exchange contracts or derivatives, because the &quot;leverage&quot; or &quot;gear&quot; effect is used during the trade. Relatively noteworthy market movements will have a proportionately increasing effect on the amount invested or deposited by you. This may be against you or against you. While supporting your position, there may be any loss in the level of the first margin and the amount of money invested in the Company. If the market has started to move in the opposite direction of your position and \/ or the amount of margin required increases, the Company may immediately ask you to make an additional amount of money to support the position. Failure to compensate for additional deposits will result in your Company&#39;s position (s) being closed and you will be responsible for any loss or deficiency associated with it.<br \/><br \/>1.2 Orders and Strategies that reduce risk<br \/>If permitted by local law, certain orders (eg &quot;stop-stop&quot; orders) or &quot;stop-limit&quot; orders limiting the maximum amount of damage can be inefficient in the case of market conditions, making it impossible to implement such orders (for example, if the market is liquidity).
